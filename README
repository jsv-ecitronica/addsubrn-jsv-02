This is a repository for a library that allows to perform arithmetic operations for Roman Numerals.
This version implements a unit testing framework with Check.

Compile all and execute the test using Check:
$ make -f ope2rn.makefile test

Compile the library and a program (main.c) application:
$ make -f ope2rn.makefile

Execution:
- You can execute the test manually using the following command:
$ ./ope2rn-test

- You can execute the console application using any of the following commands:
  Note: the debug messages are useful to see the procedure implemented
$ source ope2rn.sh    (clear the screen and executes printing debug messages) 
$ ./ope2rn pdm        (execute printing debug messages)            
$ ./ope2rn            (execute without print debug messages)

Characteristics:
- The arithmetic operations available are: addition and subtraction.
- All validations are included.
- All operations were performed using strings (or chars). Conversions to integer numbers were not performed. 
- Range of values for operations are: I - MMMCMXCIX, or 1 to 3999 in Arabic notation. 
- Allowed symbols: i,v,x,l,c,d,m and I,V,X,L,C,D,M  
- The console application request two input numbers (n1 y n2) and performs the following operations:
  - The addition n1 + n2.
  - The subtraction n1 - n2. 
  - The subtraction n2 - n1.
  - The console application could print debug messages for demonstratives purposes (if argument “pdm” is included).
  - If the addition is out of range, the answer is not presented.
  - In the subtraction, the answer is presented only when the minuend is greater than the subtrahend.  

Description of files:
addsubrn-test.check (template for the creation of the test in addsubrn-test.c)
addsubrn.c          (library for arithmetic of roman numerals, addition, subtraction, validation, other operations)
addsubrn.h          (header for declarations and definitions)
main.c              (console application for demonstrative purposes)
ope2rn.makefile     (makefile for compilation of code and test)
ope2rn.sh           (it is a shell executable file for console application)
ope2rn-test         (executable for test)
ope2rn              (executable for console application)
