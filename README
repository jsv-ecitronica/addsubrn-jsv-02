This is a repository for a library that allows to perform arithmetic operations for Roman Numerals.
This version implements a unit testing framework with Check.

Compile all and execute the test using Check:
$ make -f ope2rn.makefile test

Compile the library and a program (main.c) application:
$ make -f ope2rn.makefile

Execution:
- You can execute the test manually using the following command:
$ ./ope2rn-test

- You can execute the console application using any of the following commands:
  Note: the debug messages are useful to see the procedure implemented
$ source ope2rn.sh    (clear the screen and executes printing debug messages) 
$ ./ope2rn pdm        (execute printing debug messages)            
$ ./ope2rn            (execute without print debug messages)

Characteristics:
- The arithmetic operations available are: addition and subtraction.
- All validations are included.
- All operations were performed using strings (or chars). Conversions to integer numbers were not performed. 
- Range of values for operations are: I - MMMCMXCIX, or 1 to 3999 in Arabic notation. 
- Allowed symbols: i,v,x,l,c,d,m and I,V,X,L,C,D,M  
- The console application request two input numbers (n1 y n2) and performs the following operations:
  - The addition n1 + n2.
  - The subtraction n1 - n2. 
  - The subtraction n2 - n1.
  - The console application could print debug messages for demonstratives purposes (if argument “pdm” is included).
  - If the addition is out of range, the answer is not presented.
  - In the subtraction, the answer is presented only when the minuend is greater than the subtrahend.
